## Installing it

To install the package follow the normal go package installtion.  The go.net websocket package may need to be installed manually, and mercurial is require to pull from that repo.

```bash
go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket
go get github.com/jasondelponte/Apollo
```

## Why?
I'm very interested in Go Lang and decided to try building simple applications with it.  This app exercises some go's paralle event driven capabilities. While at the same time I'm playing around with the json encode/deocder, and websockets.

I haven't added the input controls from the client to the backend yet.  To be honest I'm not even really sure where I want to take this yet.  But I think I've found a good starting point.

## Dependencies
Right now my only dependency is garyburd/go-websocket but using the go way of installing this package the dependancy will automatically be pulled in.
